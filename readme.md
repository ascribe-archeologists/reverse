## introduction

The purpose of this repository is to document reverse engineering ascribe.io's
SPOOL protocol in hope of "reviving" it and to make its art transferrable and
ownable again.

## context

[ascribe.io](https://ascribe.io) was a startup project from Berlin that encoded
and anchored digital art on to the Bitcoin blockchain starting in 2014-2015. As
for financial reasons, the startup company maintaining the product, had to
"pivot-away": the ascribe.io system was shutdown and so today those original
NFTs aren't trivially usable anymore by us Internet Citizens

The goal of "ascribe archeologists" is to make the original art registered on
the SPOOL available to regular users again.

## problem

Its been a long time since the last person touched the official ascribe code
base and so not even all members from the original team know exactly anymore
how the SPOOL worked. Ascribe archeologists, is an effort to reveal digital
artifacts to make the SPOOL come to life again.

As a potential solution to scaling our archeological work, we believe that by
curating and gathering all possible knowledge about ascribe, we can make it
scalable and possible to re-access old art works.

Hence, the remainder of this document is simply a collection of links that
could help to encode the protocol.
